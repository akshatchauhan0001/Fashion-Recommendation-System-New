# Fashion-Recommendation-System-New
Project 1 Fashion Recommendation System using Python created in Google Colab 

Using Google Colab created a Fashion Recommendation System,here i have used Python libraries to make this deep learning model using a pre-trained CNN Resnet50 which is a pre_trained model based on imagenet dataset.

Python Version : Python 3.12.1

Dataset used here: 
Dataset 1
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikashrajluhaniwal/fashion-images
Dataset 2
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset

Can use both the datasets difference is only of size i used Dataset 1 due to its small size.
Code you find on Google are not updated as per the latest Python verion so they will not work and to create a web application used Streamlit.
While a created this code on Google colab you need to understand that this code contains commands that are used for google colab so someone working on a one own system need to manage.
